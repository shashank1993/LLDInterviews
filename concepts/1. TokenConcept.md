# Ticket or Token Concept

We will have a ticket object which will join two separate entities
together in a relation like
- Parking Ticket binding ParkingSlot and Vehicle
- BookReservation in Library binding member and BookItem
- LockerTicket in LockerService binding Locker and Package

Here one more thing is that
- Vehicle will not have parking slot
- BookItem will not have member
- Package will not have Locker as these items need not to depend
on another piece

# Parking
```plantuml
    class ParkingTicket {
        ParkingSlot parkingSlot
        Vehicle parkedVehicle
        Time entryTime
        
    }
    
    class ParkingSlot {
        status
        Vehicle parkedVehicle
    }
    
    class Vehicle {
        String registeredNumber
    }
    
    ParkingSlot <- ParkingTicket
    Vehicle <- ParkingTicket
    ParkingSlot -> Vehicle
    
```

Can use this transient entity for 
- Payment Entity
- Time entry/exit

It will have
- id, status, create_time

Vehicle will have ticket, slot will not have ticket
assignTicket()
slot will have isFree(), getParkingVehicle()

Alternate option is:
# Parking
```plantuml
    abstract class ParkingSpot {
        id
        isFree: bool
        
        getIsFree(): boolean
    }
    
    abstract class Vehicle {
        license
        + assignTicket(): ParkingTicket
    }
    
    class ParkingTicket {
        ticketNo: Integer
        timestamp: Long
        exit: date/timestamp
        amount: double
        payment: Payment
    }
    class ParkingLot {
        getParkingTicket(): ParkingTicket
    }
    
    ParkingSpot -> Vehicle
    Vehicle -> ParkingTicket
    ParkingTicket -* ParkingLot
    
```


# Library Book Reservation
```plantuml
    class BookReservation {
        
    }
    
    class BookedItem {
    }
    
    class Member {
        dateOfMembership
        totalBooksCheckedOut
        
        + getTotalBooksCheckout
        + reserveBookItem
        + incrementTotalBooksCheckout
        + checkForFine
        + renewBookItem
    }
    
    class BookLending {
        itemId: String
        creationDate: String
        dueDate: date 
        returnDate: date 
        memberId: String
        
        + lendBook(BookItem, memberId)
        + fetchLendingDetails(BookItem)    
    }
    
    Member <-> BookReservation
    BookReservation -> BookedItem
    BookedItem <- Member
    BookLending - BookReservation
    BookLending - Member
    
```

Here checkForFine and renewBookItem, kept at Member level ie Member Service
for solving the use case without overcomplicating
