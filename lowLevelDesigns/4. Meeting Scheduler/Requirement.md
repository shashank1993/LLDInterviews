A meeting scheduler software allows organizations to schedule and book meetings for a group of participants. The scheduler determines a meeting time and location depending on the availability of the participants. It ensures that most of the intended participants can effectively meet on the specified date and interval. The system allows users to book and cancel meetings. The invited participants promptly receive these notifications. The organizer can also add new participants to a meeting after the meeting is scheduled.
